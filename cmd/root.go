	Short: "Go! Tame! Me! CLI for managing and interacting with the Go! Tame! Me! ant simulation project.",
	Long: `Go! Tame! Me! CLI is a command-line interface designed to streamline the development and management of
the Go! Tame! Me! simulation game. It provides developers and users with tools to create, manage, and interact with the
ant simulation environment efficiently. Whether you're looking to initiate a new simulation, manage existing
simulations, or integrate with the broader Go! Tame! Me! ecosystem, gtm-cli facilitates these operations through a
simple and intuitive command-line interface.

For example, you can start a new ant simulation, deploy scenarios, or analyze simulation outcomes with commands like:

    $ gtm-cli init --name="AwesomeAnt"
    $ gtm-cli run MyFirstAnt/main.go

Developed with the open-source community in mind, gtm-cli aims to provide an accessible and powerful tool for both
educational purposes and serious simulation endeavors.`,
